# website

A minimal personal site for sharing passion projects with a simple, modern aesthetic.

## Available pages

- **Home (`index.html`)** – Centered title card with a floating navigation toggle that opens links to Projects and About Me.
- **Projects (`projects/index.html`)** – Interactive tiles featuring the NBA Drinking Game prototype and three "Coming Soon" placeholders.
- **About Me (`about.html`)** – Coming soon sign while the bio is under construction.
- **NBA Drinking Game (`projects/nba-drinking-game.html`)** – Full party loop with a persistent lobby, scoreboard, and mystery-player rounds with hints and reveal screens.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the experience. The interface is built with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and a touch of vanilla JavaScript for interactions.
