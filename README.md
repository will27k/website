# website

A concept portfolio site showcasing experimental builds inspired by Sora&apos;s cinematic visuals.

## Available pages

- **Home (`index.html`)** – Hero imagery sourced from Sora&apos;s user generated photos, navigation drawer, featured project, and about section.
- **NBA Drinking Game Lobby (`projects/nba-drinking-game.html`)** – Prototype lobby where you can add or remove players before the rule builder is ready.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser to explore the experience. The interface is built with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and a touch of vanilla JavaScript for interactions.
